## Survey
+ **A Comprehensive Survey of Graph Embedding: Problems, Techniques and Applications**
  + **Authors:** Hongyun Cai, Vencent W. Zheng, and Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang
  + **Affiliation:** Advanced Digital Sciences Center, University of Illinois
  + **Publiser:** IEEE
  + **Year of Publication:** 2018
  + **Download:** [PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8294302)
  + **Keywords:** Graph Embedding, Graph Analytics, Graph Embedding Survey, Network Embedding
  + **Highlights:** This paper
    +  introduces the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts.
    +  proposes two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address these challenges in their solutions.
    +  summarizes the applications that graph embedding enables and suggests four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and application scenarios.
+ **Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications**
  + **Authors:** Jie Zhou, Ganqu Cui, Zhengyan Zhang, et al.
  + **Affiliation:** Tsinghua University, Tencent
  + **Publisher:** arXiv
  + **Year of Publication:** 2019
  + **Download:** [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf)
  + **Keywords:** Deep Learning, Graph Neural Network 
  + **Highlights:** This paper
    + provides a detailed review over existing graph neural network models and their varients in terms of graph types(directed graphs, heterogeneous graphs, graphs with edge information, dynamic graphs), propagation types(convolution, gate, attention, skip connection, hierarchical pooling), and training methods(sampling, receptive field control, data augmentation, unsupervised training). Moreover, it also introduces serveral general frameworks(MPNN, NLNN, GN).
    + systematically categorizes the applications and divides the applications into structural scenarios, non-structural scenarios and other scenarios.
    + proposes four open problems(shallow structure, dynamic graphs, non-structural scenarios, scalability) for future research.
